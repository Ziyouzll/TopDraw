# TopDraw
It can create a top layer of translucent window for drawing lines, the main purpose is to pause the video while watching the learning video to make a temporary draft or markup, maybe it can help you, so I posted it to github, of course, if there is a better tool than this please contact me Chidng2002@outlook.com
